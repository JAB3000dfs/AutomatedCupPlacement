AUTONOMOUS CUP PLACEMENT ROBOT

This projects goal was to develop a robot whose aim was to autonomously arrange a specific number of cups in predefined
patterns. These patterns range from standard cup pong formations to custom layouts inputted
through files or selected by the user during startup. The primary focus of the robot was to
achieve accurate and precise cup layouts with minimal human intervention being necessary. The
robot used inputs from various sources, including files, user input, motor encoders, a gyro sensor,
and a color sensor, to inform its actions during the cup arrangement process.
The mechanical design whose main features were cup containment and placement, underwent
independent development to ensure each part's functionality before integration. Custom-designed
gears and spacers were designed to improve cup containment, while a spinning wheel addressed
challenges that were faced with gravitational cup ejection. The claw mechanism, equipped with a
colour sensor, ensures accurate cup placement and provides error detection and retry capabilities.
Thorough testing of each individual mechanism as well the complete system validated the
mechanical design's functionality.
The programming structure for the robot involved various functions, such as adjustRobot,
rotateRobot, drive, createCoords, EjectCup, menu, custom layout, and rotate robot. Various
challenges were faced when integrating the various components of the entire system together
such as gyro sensor inaccuracies, robot drift, and a lack of wheel traction, which were
subsequently addressed through extensive testing.
Despite these challenges, the robot successfully achieves its primary objective, demonstrating its
potential for use in social settings and laying the groundwork for potential improvements and
future iterations.
